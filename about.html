  <p>What is Shitty Secret Santa?</p>
  <p>Is that a real question? I feel like it's all in the name. Imagine secret santa, but the gifts are mentally and emotionally scarring.</p>

  <p>Why are there so few images?</p>
  <p>Some things are better left to the imagination.</p>

  <p>Who is Secreto Santar?</p>
  <p>Some say he's Santa's evil twin brother. Many antideluvian religions worship him as a fell god. All I know is, he smells like old fish.</p>

  <p>This site hurts to look at!</p>
  <p>That's not a question.</p>

  <p>I have more questions, can I contact you?</p>
  <p>Absolutely not.</p>
